Your frontend socket connection is incorrect for a deployed environment. Right now, your frontend is trying to connect to http://localhost:3001, which only works in local development.

Step-by-Step Fixes for Deployment
1. Update REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL
Go to Render Dashboard â†’ Your Frontend Service â†’ Environment Variables.
Change the value of REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL from:
http://localhost:3001

to:

https://your-backend-service.onrender.com
(Replace your-backend-service.onrender.com with your actual backend URL from Render.)
2. Update socket.js in Frontend
Modify your initSocket function to correctly connect to the backend:


import { io } from "socket.io-client";

export const initSocket = async () => {
    const options = {
        forceNew: true, // Fixed option name
        reconnectionAttempts: Infinity, // Fixed property name
        timeout: 10000,
        transports: ["websocket"],
    };

    return io(process.env.REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL, options);
};
ðŸ”¹ Fixes applied:

Corrected force new connection to forceNew
Corrected reconnectionAttempt to reconnectionAttempts
Ensured environment variable is used correctly
3. Fix Backend CORS Issues
Open server.js in your backend.
Add CORS support to allow WebSocket connections from your frontend:
js

const cors = require("cors");

app.use(cors({
    origin: process.env.FRONTEND_URL || "*", // Allow only your frontend
    methods: ["GET", "POST"],
}));
ðŸ”¹ Set FRONTEND_URL in Render â†’ Backend â†’ Environment Variables

FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend-service.onrender.com
4. Restart Both Services
Go to Render Dashboard.
Restart both frontend and backend services so they use the updated variables.
5. Test the Connection
Open your browser DevTools (F12).
Go to Console and check if there are any WebSocket errors.
If the connection still fails, check Render Logs in your backend for errors.
